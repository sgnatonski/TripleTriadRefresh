    Welcome to Triple Triad Refresh - a clone of popular mini-game introduced in Final Fantasy VIII.
    This is initial game rolluot that should be considered an early alpha, so expect numerous bugs, regular data wipe and many other nice things ;). Also not every aspect of the game is yet functional.
    When development progresses important changes will be announced, so stay tuned and feel free to use and enjoy those parts of Triple Triad Refresh that are currently playable.
